Getting Started with MITgcm
****************************

This chapter is divided into two main parts. The first part, which is
covered in sections \ref{sec:whereToFindInfo} through
\ref{sec:testing}, contains information about how to run experiments
using MITgcm. The second part, covered in sections
\ref{sec:eg-baro} through \ref{sec:eg-offline}, contains a set of
step-by-step tutorials for running specific pre-configured atmospheric
and oceanic experiments.

We believe the best way to familiarize yourself with the
model is to run the case study examples provided with the base
version. Information on how to obtain, compile, and run the code is
found here as well as a brief description of the model structure
directory and the case study examples. Information is also provided
here on how to customize the code when you are ready to try implementing 
the configuration you have in mind.  The code and algorithm
are described more fully in chapters \ref{chap:discretization} and 
\ref{chap:sarch}.
