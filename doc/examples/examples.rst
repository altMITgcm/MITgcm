MITgcm Example Experiments
**************************



The full MITgcm distribution comes with a set of pre-configured
numerical experiments.  Some of these example experiments are tests of
individual parts of the model code, but many are fully fledged
numerical simulations. Full tutorials exist for a few of the examples,
and are documented in sections :numref:`sec_eg_baro` -
:numref:`sec_eg_tank`. The other examples follow the same general
structure as the tutorial examples. However, they only include brief
instructions in a text file called {\it README}.  The examples are
located in subdirectories under the directory \texttt{verification}.
Each example is briefly described below.

Once you have chosen the example you want to run, you are ready to
compile the code.
