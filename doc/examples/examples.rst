MITgcm Example Experiments
**************************



The full MITgcm distribution comes with a set of pre-configured
numerical experiments.  Some of these example experiments are tests of
individual parts of the model code, but many are fully fledged
numerical simulations. Full tutorials exist for a few of the examples,
and are documented in sections \ref{sec:eg-baro} -
\ref{sec:eg-tank}. The other examples follow the same general
structure as the tutorial examples. However, they only include brief
instructions in a text file called {\it README}.  The examples are
located in subdirectories under the directory \texttt{verification}.
Each example is briefly described below.

\subsection{Directory structure of model examples}

Each example directory has the following subdirectories:

\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{code}: contains the code particular to the example. At a
  minimum, this directory includes the following files:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{code/packages.conf}: declares the list of packages or
    package groups to be used.  If not included, the default version
    is located in \texttt{pkg/pkg\_default}.  Package groups are
    simply convenient collections of commonly used packages which are
    defined in \texttt{pkg/pkg\_default}.  Some packages may require
    other packages or may require their absence (that is, they are
    incompatible) and these package dependencies are listed in
    \texttt{pkg/pkg\_depend}.

  \item \texttt{code/CPP\_EEOPTIONS.h}: declares CPP keys relative to
    the ``execution environment'' part of the code. The default
    version is located in \texttt{eesupp/inc}.

  \item \texttt{code/CPP\_OPTIONS.h}: declares CPP keys relative to
    the ``numerical model'' part of the code. The default version is
    located in \texttt{model/inc}.

  \item \texttt{code/SIZE.h}: declares size of underlying
    computational grid.  The default version is located in
    \texttt{model/inc}.
  \end{itemize}

  In addition, other include files and subroutines might be present in
  \texttt{code} depending on the particular experiment. See Section 2
  for more details.

\item \texttt{input}: contains the input data files required to run
  the example. At a minimum, the \texttt{input} directory contains the
  following files:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{input/data}: this file, written as a namelist,
    specifies the main parameters for the experiment.

  \item \texttt{input/data.pkg}: contains parameters relative to the
    packages used in the experiment.

  \item \texttt{input/eedata}: this file contains ``execution
    environment'' data. At present, this consists of a specification
    of the number of threads to use in $X$ and $Y$ under multi-threaded
    execution.
  \end{itemize}

  In addition, you will also find in this directory the forcing and
  topography files as well as the files describing the initial state
  of the experiment.  This varies from experiment to experiment. See
  the verification directories refered to in this chapter for more details.

\item \texttt{results}: this directory contains the output file
  \texttt{output.txt} produced by the simulation example. This file is
  useful for comparison with your own output when you run the
  experiment.

\item \texttt{build}: this directory is initially empty and is used
  to compile and load the model, and to generate the executable.

\item \texttt{run}: this directory is initially empty and is used
  to run the executable.

\end{itemize}

Once you have chosen the example you want to run, you are ready to
compile the code.
