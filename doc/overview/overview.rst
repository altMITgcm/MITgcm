Overview
********

This document provides the reader with the information necessary to
carry out numerical experiments using MITgcm. It gives a comprehensive
description of the continuous equations on which the model is based, the
numerical algorithms the model employs and a description of the associated
program code. Along with the hydrodynamical kernel, physical and
biogeochemical parameterizations of key atmospheric and oceanic processes
are available. A number of examples illustrating the use of the model in
both process and general circulation studies of the atmosphere and ocean are
also presented.

Introduction
============

MITgcm has a number of novel aspects:

 - it can be used to study both atmospheric and oceanic phenomena; one hydrodynamical kernel is used to drive forward both atmospheric and oceanic models - see :numref:`onemodel`

    :name: onemodel

    MITgcm has a single dynamical kernel that can drive forward either oceanic or atmospheric simulations.


 - it has a non-hydrostatic capability and so can be used to study both small-scale and large scale processes - see :numref:`all-scales`

    MITgcm has non-hydrostatic capabilities, allowing the model to address a wide range of phenomenon - from convection on the left, all the way through to global circulation patterns on the right.

 - finite volume techniques are employed yielding an intuitive discretization and support for the treatment of irregular geometries using orthogonal curvilinear grids and shaved cells - see :numref:`fvol`

    Finite volume techniques (bottom panel) are user, permitting a treatment of topography that rivals :math:`\sigma` (terrain following) coordinates.

 - tangent linear and adjoint counterparts are automatically maintained along with the forward model, permitting sensitivity and optimization studies.

 - the model is developed to perform efficiently on a wide variety of computational platforms.


Key publications reporting on and charting the development of the model are :cite:`hill:95,marshall:97a,marshall:97b,adcroft:97,mars-eta:98,adcroft:99,hill:99,maro-eta:99,adcroft:04a,adcroft:04b,marshall:04` (an overview on the model formulation can also be found in :cite:`adcroft:04c`):

We begin by briefly showing some of the results of the model in action to
give a feel for the wide range of problems that can be addressed using it.


Illustrations of the model in action
====================================


Convection and mixing over topography
-------------------------------------

Dense plumes generated by localized cooling on the continental shelf of the
ocean may be influenced by rotation when the deformation radius is smaller
than the width of the cooling region. Rather than gravity plumes, the
mechanism for moving dense fluid down the shelf is then through geostrophic
eddies. The simulation shown in :numref:`fig_convect_and_topo`
(blue is cold dense fluid, red is
warmer, lighter fluid) employs the non-hydrostatic capability of MITgcm to
trigger convection by surface cooling. The cold, dense water falls down the
slope but is deflected along the slope by rotation. It is found that
entrainment in the vertical plane is reduced when rotational control is
strong, and replaced by lateral entrainment due to the baroclinic
instability of the along-slope current.

    MITgcm run in a non-hydrostatic configuration to study convection over a slope.


Boundary forced internal waves
------------------------------

The unique ability of MITgcm to treat non-hydrostatic dynamics in the
presence of complex geometry makes it an ideal tool to study internal wave
dynamics and mixing in oceanic canyons and ridges driven by large amplitude
barotropic tidal currents imposed through open boundary conditions.
