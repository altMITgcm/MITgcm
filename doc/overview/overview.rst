Overview
********

This document provides the reader with the information necessary to
carry out numerical experiments using MITgcm. It gives a comprehensive
description of the continuous equations on which the model is based, the
numerical algorithms the model employs and a description of the associated
program code. Along with the hydrodynamical kernel, physical and
biogeochemical parameterizations of key atmospheric and oceanic processes
are available. A number of examples illustrating the use of the model in
both process and general circulation studies of the atmosphere and ocean are
also presented.
